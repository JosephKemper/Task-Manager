# Overview

My goal for creating this project is demonstrate my ability to meet deadlines and work under
pressure while still producing viable product that meet my goals, plan and organize projects,
learn new programming languages, learn new tools, and use those same tools and programming
languages to create a usable program.

The minimum viable product for this program that I will be finishing on or before 30 September 
2023 will be a console based Kotlin task manager program that will let users create tasks, list 
them for easy reference, and delete any completed tasks.  

If I get this completed before 30 September 2023, instead of adding extra features to the 
program right now, I will go ahead and work on the next program I will be adding to my portfolio.
If after I complete the sixth portfolio project, I have more time before 13 December 2023 (when 
I plan to have all six projects finished, I will then see what project I can add to that will 
add the most value to my portfolio and expand on that project first. After I have completed all 
six of my portfolio projects, I will take turns in future sprints either expanding on an 
existing project or creating a new one.
